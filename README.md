# GettingDataCoursera
Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera
The R script in this repository can be run by changing the working directory path at the top of the script to a directory that contains the Samsung accelerometer data, with the original data locations (files and folders) maintained. The script produces a tidy dataset called "meanset.txt" as a pipe-delimited text file, as well as a csv file that forms the core of the data dictionary, or code book.
